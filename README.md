# SimonSaysGame
The Simon Says Game is an interactive web-based memory game developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game begins when the user presses any key and displays a sequence of colored button flashes. The player must repeat the sequence in the correct order. 
With each level, the sequence length increases, making the game more challenging. If the user presses an incorrect button, the game ends and the final score is displayed. This project helps in understanding JavaScript fundamentals such as arrays, functions, event listeners, and DOM manipulation.
